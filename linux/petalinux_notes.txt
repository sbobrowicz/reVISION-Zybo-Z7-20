**WARNING--Most changes were captured in this document, but it was not 
           verified that all changes are documented here.

This petalinux project was created from the petalinux project found here:

https://github.com/Digilent/Petalinux-Zybo-Z7-20

The release point used is Petalinux-Zybo-Z7-20-2017.2-1.

========================================
Changes made for SDSoC/reVISION support
========================================

The steps found in the Linux Boot Files section of UG1146 (page 31) were followed to make the 
Linux system suitable for an SDSoC platform. In addition to these changes, the following changes were
also made:

1) Instead of modifying the bootargs in the petalinux-config menu, the system-user.dtsi file was modified to include "quiet".

2)Based on references in the ZCU102 revision platform, Instead of the xlnk device tree node cited in ug1146, the following was
  used (which puts the node in amba):

&amba {
	xlnk {
		compatible = "xlnx,xlnk-1.0";
	};
};

3) Added the following packages using petalinux-config -c rootfs

	misc->packagegroup-petalinux-opencv
	misc->gdb->gdbserver
	console->utils->file->file
	console->utils->strace->strace
	misc->valgrind
	
4) Manually added all new Digilent apps. This is because they have not been committed yet to the upstream project, but will
   be useful to sdsoc users. In future releases of this project, this step won't be necessary, because the upstream petalinux project
   will already include these apps by default.

   Also, enabled several in petalinux-config -c rootfs.

5) Modified sw,btn, and led device tree nodes to load uio driver. Again, similar to #4, this should not be necessary once it gets fixed
   upstream.

6) Deleted pre-built folder to save space

7) Including opencv and the other rootfs libraries causes the ramdisk size to increase to >128MB. Booting with a ramdisk this large 
   is not currently working, so we had to switch to SD rootfs. This has other benefits, including additional available system memory,
   persistent modifications, and increased system performance in some scenarios. The main cost of this is added complexity to the SD
   card preparation, because the image has to be flashed onto the SD card. 

   The idea that this issue is caused by the rootfs being larger than 128MB compressed is speculation, another possibility is that 
   this is being caused by the existence of some hard links present in the opencv packages that are incompatible with the cpio 
   compression used with the initramdisk. 

   That was the explanation, the how is as follows: used petalinux-config to change Root Filesystem type to "SD Card" as described in
   the petalinux README.md, being careful not to remove "quiet" from the bootargs in the device tree.

   root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait
