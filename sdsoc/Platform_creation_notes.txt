Random Notes on Creating an SDSoC Platform using these files
===================================================================

--lscript.ld were Generated from a simple helloworld project in sdk with heap and stack increased to 0x10000000 and 0x40000. 
  Additional changes are also manually made to the freertos .ld (see a diff of the two files).

--Used GUI to generate makefile, currently encountering warning that suggests the archive is not properly finding the boardfiles. Also, the problem 
  specified here might be relevant, as that is the actual error I am receiving:

  UPDATE: This bug was actually two bugs, I squashed them by doing two things:
     1) Installed the zybo-z7 board files directly to /opt/Xilinx/SDx/2017.2/Vivado/data/boards/board_files. Removed copies of board files in proj_copy,
        because they were not making it to the temporary archive created by spspfm anyways.
     2) Deleted ~/.Xilinx/ . This fixed the issue in the forum above. 

  I think the proper way to handle this problem is to document #2, but to undo #1 and remove the references to the board files in 
  the vivado project, using the XDC to set constraints instead.

--The method used to copy sysroot seems to break some links in /bin and /sbin. That should be
  irrelevant since this folder will only be used for cross-compiling and linking in libraries and includes. 
  It also seems like the ZCU102 platform ran into this same issue, because many of the broken links are also removed from their /bin folder.

--It seems the issue where you can't select the linux root file system in SDSoC occurs when the Linux operating system is not set as the default OS. This
  is definitely a Xilinx-side bug, but I need to workaround and modify the Makefile so that it puts the Linux OS as the default configuration. I can probably
  do this by just moving it ahead of the other OS's in the Makefile. UPDATE: Turns out that Xilinx recommends you avoid setting the Linux Root File System setting in the 
  wizard anyways. So this issue is irrelevant.

--Need to ask Xilinx about the "fatal error: 'gnu/stubs-soft.h' file not found" error. It seems that SDSoC tries to compile with soft-float by default, but my
  linux image only supports hard float. My current workaround is to add __ARM_PCS_VFP to the symbols for the SDSCC compiler and SDSC++ compiler using project
  settings. UPDATE This error completely goes away when you don't specify root fs (I haven't double checked this). It seems Xilinx currently works around this 
  by specifying this symbol (and others) as well as some compiler/linker options, in the sample json files.

--Looks like I need to have users of the platform run export SYSROOT=<Platform Location>zybo_z7_20/sw/sysroot before launching sdx. This might be a problem in Windows.

--Need to add -maxthreads 8 -maxjobs 16 to Miscellanous in C/C++ build settings for SDSCC,SDS++, and SDS Linkerin order to speed up builds.
